These are Common Table Expressions I used to answer business questions for a data analytics project.

CTE to find the average amount paid by the top 5 customers:

WITH total_amount_cte (customer_id, first_name, Last_name, city, country, total_amount_paid) 
AS (SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name,
    C.city, D.country,
    SUM(amount) AS total_amount_paid
    FROM customer A
    INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
    INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
    INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
    INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
    WHERE city IN('Aurora', 'Tokat', 'Tarsus', 'Atlixco', 'Emeishan', 'Pontianak', 
			             'Shimoga', 'Aparecida de Goinia', 'Zalantun', 'Taguig')
    GROUP BY A.customer_id, C.city, D.country
    ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
    LIMIT 5)
SELECT AVG(total_amount_paid) AS average
FROM total_amount_cte

CTE to find out how many of the top 5 customers are based within each country:

WITH top_five_cte (customer_id, first_name, last_name, city, country, total_amount_paid)
AS (SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name,
    C.city, D.country,
    SUM(amount) AS total_amount_paid
    FROM customer A
    INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
    INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
    INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
    INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
    WHERE city IN('Aurora', 'Tokat', 'Tarsus', 'Atlixco', 'Emeishan', 'Pontianak', 
			            'Shimoga', 'Aparecida de Goinia', 'Zalantun', 'Taguig')
    GROUP BY A.customer_id, C.city, D.country
    ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
    LIMIT 5)
SELECT country.country,
COUNT(DISTINCT customer.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
COUNT(DISTINCT top_five_cte.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
FROM country
INNER JOIN city ON country.country_id = city.country_id
INNER JOIN address ON city.city_id = address.city_id
INNER JOIN customer ON address.address_id = customer.address_id
LEFT JOIN top_five_cte ON country.country = top_five_cte.country
GROUP BY country.country
ORDER BY COUNT(DISTINCT top_five_cte.customer_id) DESC
LIMIT 5
