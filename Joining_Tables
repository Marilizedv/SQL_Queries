SQL Queries I wrote to Join multiple Tables

INNER JOIN to reveal Top 10 Countries:

SELECT D.country,
COUNT(customer_id) AS number_of_customers
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY COUNT(customer_id) DESC
LIMIT 10

INNER JOIN to reveal Top 10 Cities from the Top 10 Countries revealed from the query above:

SELECT C.city,
COUNT(customer_id) AS number_of_customers
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
WHERE country IN('India', 'China', 'United States', 
                 'Japan', 'Mexico', 'Brazil', 
                 'Russian Federation', 'Philippines',
                 'Turkey', 'Indonesia')
GROUP BY C.city
ORDER BY COUNT(customer_id) DESC
LIMIT 10

INNER JOIN to reveal Top 5 customers from the Top 10 Cities revealed from the query above:

SELECT A.customer_id, 
A.first_name, 
A.last_name,
C.city, 
D.country,
SUM(amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
WHERE city IN('Aurora', 'Tokat', 'Tarsus', 'Atlixco', 'Emeishan', 'Pontianak', 
			  'Shimoga', 'Aparecida de Goinia', 'Zalantun', 'Taguig')
GROUP BY A.customer_id, C.city, D.country
