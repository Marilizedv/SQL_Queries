Below are queries and subqueries I wrote for my data analytics project

Subquery to find the average amount paid by the top 5 customers:

SELECT AVG(total_amount_paid.total_amount_paid) AS average
FROM (SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name,
      C.city, D.country,
      SUM(amount) AS total_amount_paid
      FROM customer A
      INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
      INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
      INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
      INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
      WHERE city IN('Aurora', 'Tokat', 'Tarsus', 'Atlixco', 'Emeishan', 'Pontianak', 
			              'Shimoga', 'Aparecida de Goinia', 'Zalantun', 'Taguig')
      GROUP BY A.customer_id, C.city, D.country
      ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
      LIMIT 5) AS total_amount_paid

Subquery to find out how many of the top 5 customers are based within each country:

SELECT country.country,
COUNT(DISTINCT customer.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
COUNT(DISTINCT top_five_customers.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
FROM country
INNER JOIN city ON country.country_id = city.country_id
INNER JOIN address ON city.city_id = address.city_id
INNER JOIN customer ON address.address_id = customer.address_id
LEFT JOIN (SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name,
           C.city, D.country,
           SUM(amount) AS total_amount_paid
           FROM customer A
           INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
           INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
           INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
           INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
           WHERE city IN('Aurora', 'Tokat', 'Tarsus', 'Atlixco', 'Emeishan', 'Pontianak', 
			                   'Shimoga', 'Aparecida de Goinia', 'Zalantun', 'Taguig')
           GROUP BY A.customer_id, C.city, D.country
           ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
           LIMIT 5) AS top_five_customers 
ON country.country = top_five_customers.country
GROUP BY country.country
ORDER BY COUNT(DISTINCT top_five_customers.customer_id) DESC
LIMIT 5
