# SQL_Queries
SQL queries I wrote for a data analytics (data immersion) course at CareerFoundry
### Description of Project
**Imaginary Scenario:** _You’ve been hired as a data analyst by Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence (BI)
department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI
department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related
queries. Your first task is to load all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database
management system (RDBMS). Then, you’ll use SQL to analyze the data and answer any
ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have._
### Key Questions answered using SQL
1. Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
2. What was the average rental duration for all videos?
3. Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
4. Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
5. Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
### Dataset Used
The data set used for this project contains information about Rockbuster’s 
film inventory, customers, and payments, among other things. This dataset is a tutorial dataset of PostgreSQL.
